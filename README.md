Welcome Professor!

To begin this project, begin by cloning the entire repository. You will then want to run "npm install mongoose" to install mongoose for use wtih the web app. Then, run "mongorestore --db ecorp_bank" to download the databse with current data for use. Finally run node app.mjs to start the web server and connect the database. Make sure you're in the correct folder, as sometimes even I mess up and end up in the wrong one.  

The local address to access the site is http://localhost:1234/  

Other than that, you can just explore! The appliction link will lead you to our main point within the project, which is being able to apply to loans and credit cards! You must be signed into user account to reach the application page.

You can still fill out an application and it is fully written to catch errors to not allow submission until all criteria is met. It will prompt with successful submission if filled out properly and submitted.  

Other than that, the other links within the left navbar work as well, but aren't completely finished in terms of CSS, as we are still deciding on a central theme concerning our CSS.   

There are a few test users setup for use of login, dashboard view, and access to the application page.

username: tyrell.wellick

username: phillip.price

username: angela.moss

We are also currently working on implementing more ARG themes, as that is a more predominate CSS and small script functions, and we want to make sure the databases work completely and well before focusing on looks and fun little interactables!  

Thanks for trying out our project!
