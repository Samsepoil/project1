Welcome Professor!

To begin this project, simply clone the entire repository and run node app.mjs. Make sure you're in the correct folder, as sometimes even I mess up and end up in the wrong one.
The local address to access the site is http://localhost:1234/
Other than that, you can just explore! The appliction link will lead you to our main point within the project, which is being able to apply to loans and credit cards!
It is conneceted to a database, but currently is unusable as we are still working out the user profile creation database!
You can still fill out an application and it is fully written to catch errors to not allow submission until all criteria is met. It will prompt with successful submission if filled out properly and submitted.
Other than that, the other links within the left navbar work as well, but aren't completely finished in terms of CSS, as we are still deciding on a central theme concerning our CSS.
User login also currently doesn't work for users in the DB as we're trying to figure out connecting the two databases.
There is a test user setup to allow for successful login, but dashboard page is still incomplete so you will only be able to test login. Incorrect login will properly display login error at the moment. 
Username: testuser
Password: password


We are also currently working on implementing more ARG themes, as that is a more predominat CSS function, and we want to make sure the databases work completely and well before focusing on looks and fun little interactables!

Thanks for trying out our project!
