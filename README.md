Welcome Professor!

To begin this project, simply download the entire repository and run node app.mjs. Make sure you're in the correct folder, as sometimes even I mess up and end up in the wrong one.
Other than that, you can just explore! The appliction link will lead you to our main point within the project, which is being able to apply to loans and credit cards!
It is conneceted to a database, but currently is unusable as we are still working out the user profile creation database!
Other than that, the other links within the left navbar work as well, but aren't completely finished in terms of CSS, as we are still deciding on a central theme concerning our CSS.
User login also currently doesn't work, as we're trying to figure out connecting the two databases.

We are also currently working on implementing more ARG themes, as that is a more predominat CSS function, and we want to make sure the databases work completely and well before focusing on looks and fun little interactables!

Thanks for trying out our project!
